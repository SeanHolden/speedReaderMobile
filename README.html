<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>There are a few speed reader apps out there but I couldn&#39;t find a good one that allows you to skip back and forth between sentences and also allows for pausing at punctuation. So I made one that does.</p>
<p><b>Features</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Copy and paste (or type) text into the text area, and simply press play.</li>
<li>Skip back if you missed a sentence. Skip forward if the current sentence is boring.</li>
<li>Add long or short pauses at punctuation. For example: have a 2 second pause at full stops. Have a 0.5 second pause at commas. Have a 1 second pause at colons. This gives your brain time to process the sentence.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Extra info</b></p>
<p>This is not on app store or google play store as I wasn&#39;t totally happy with how it looks and feels when put on mobile. It is great as a web app, but I guess it is difficult to make a phonegap app truly feel native. Issues such as text looking weird and &quot;off&quot; at random intervals. Also, sometimes the words flashing on screen will &quot;lag&quot; for a microsecond and then suddenly go super fast to &quot;catch up&quot;. This is not so often, but annoying still.</p>
<p><b>To run on browser</b></p>
<p>Clone the repo and run a server from the <code>www</code> folder. Open it via localhost in your browser.</p>
<p><b>To run on mobile</b></p>
<p>Have <code>ionic</code> framework installed: (<a href="http://ionicframework.com/"><a href="http://ionicframework.com/">http://ionicframework.com/</a></a>)</p>
<pre><code>$ ionic platform add android
$ ionic build android
$ ionic run android</code></pre>
<p>If device is plugged in, it will auto launch on your phone. (Replace <code>android</code> with <code>ios</code> for iPhone, but I&#39;ve not tried this as I don&#39;t have an iPhone...)</p>
